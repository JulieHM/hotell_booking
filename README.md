### Prerequisites

*  [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/) or later

* MySQL package for Python. Can be installed with the following command:

```
pip install mysql-connector
```
If there is an error related to the SQL package while running the server, try:
```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

### Installing

Go to [the gitlab repository](https://gitlab.stud.iie.ntnu.no/tdt4140-2020/40) while being connected to [NTNU VPN](https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Install+vpn) and download the projcet as a zip file.

To run the server on the local host, make sure you are in the same directory as the project and run the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

This would look something like this if you just extracted the zip file to your desktop:
```
C:\Users\user_name\Desktop\40-master\fancyhotel python manage.py runserver
```
